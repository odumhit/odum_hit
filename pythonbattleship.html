    <center><h2>The Experience</h2></center>
    <center><p>This program was created by my partner Tyler Hit and I. As soon as we started to create the program, we faced major difficulties. We envisioned a grid 
    in which coordinates would be randomly placed, and initiially this could not be done because we did not have algorithms to create such a grid. After some research, we discovered 
    append which would put items into a list. Append allows us to input squares that would be set into rows and columns, allowing us to further progress. Other difficulties that 
    occurred were awkwards miscalculations of coordinate placement. For example, the location (2,2) would actually become placed at (3,3). This later fixed by improving the arthmetic 
    equation for the random coordinate placement.</p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>I thought that I became knowledgeable of python, but this project quickly disproved that notion. It was a great experience that allowed me to explore complicating algorithms and 
    new terms. Before this project, I did not understand the complexities that could contribute to such a simple looking program. By utilizing append and multi-step algorithms, I realized that I 
    started to gain a greater comfortability with the content.</p>
