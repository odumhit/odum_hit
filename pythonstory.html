    <center><h2>The Experience</h2></center>
    <center><p>This program was created by my partner Jose Ramos and I. During the preparatory phase, we found ourselves experiencing trouble since we only had a small 
    number of paths the story could follow. After deciding the final events, we began by naming the functions that would allow ourselves to organize future paths of the story.
    I found the introduction to python in replit to be much easier than scratch or app inventor because of the wide range of functions that can be created. The only issue I came 
    up with was indentation errors and missing punctuation. This usually came up with if-else statements because if either one indent was off or one colon was missing, the entire 
    program would fail. Due to the built-in system that reveals where the error occurred in the engine, we were able to quickly locate and add what was necessary.</p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>I initially viewed Python's low abstraction to be a large difficulty; however, this changed once I started to focus on completing individual tasks one after the other. 
    By focusing on mainly if-else statements and creating organized functions with proper labels, the overall task became much more feasible to me. I maintained use of the functions 
    that I knew to keep myself efficient, working around any obstacles that would require more complicating algorithms such as for and while loops with if-else statements integrated 
    within them.</p>
