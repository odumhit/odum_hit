    <center><h1>The Experience</h1></center>
    <center><p>App Inventor was similar to Scratch, so it was easy to transition to. I worked with Cecilia Mendoza on this project, and by doing so, the management of such tasks were easier to accomplish. Initially 
we had difficulty in deciding what to program because of our lack of familiarity with the program, but by building upon our knowledge of the examples weâ€™ve practiced on, we decided to utilize scribbling 
as a central aspect. What I found most difficult with App Inventor was importing images that would properly adapt to the screen. App inventor allows you to fit an image to the screen by filling, but by doing so, the actual
image itself would become distorted. Also, our app did not start off as user-friendly because of the inability to write along the sides of the screen, interfering with their practice. To fix this problem, my partner and I decided to 
reduce the images' sizes, so even though writing along the sides of the screens is still difficult, the user will no longer be affected by it.

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>Currently, I feel as though I'm gaining a better understanding of high abstraction programs. My ability to compose algorithms through existing blocks has improved as I can now understand how to call upon other algorithms
    especially through the scribbling and navigation of the screens.</p>
