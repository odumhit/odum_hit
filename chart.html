    <center><h1>The Experience</h1></center>
    <center><p>I percieved this project to be much more feasible due to my collaboration with two partners (Jacqueline Guerra and Samuel Salazar) and 
    our manipulation of pie charts. Before working on this we spent a large amount of time on what I considered to be simplistic pie charts. We also explored histograms and 
    scatter plots, but for our purpose, a pie chart was most important in representing our raw data gathered from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The main issues that arose were
    floating points because we were not immediately decisive on what would be best. It was quickly resolved as we decided to have enough room for the rest of the pie chart two look 
    simplistic by changing the floating point to 1.2%.</p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>This project allowed me to gain a better understanding of how data can be transformed through python along with the statistics revolving around lawyers within the US. I also learned to distinguish the importance of each 
    type of graph to represent the given data.</p>
