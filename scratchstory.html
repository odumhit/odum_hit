    <center><h2>The Experience</h2></center>
    <center><p>As the first project of the year, I can clearly say that my Scratch story was successful, and that was made possible with the help of my partner, Flor Hernandez.
              I had a difficult time at first mainly because I was still trying to understand the creation of algorithms through the program's features, but this lack of comprehension only lasted for a couple of days.
              Afterwards, I was able to focus and acted with my upmost efficiency to produce a story that my partner and I had envisioned. I would not necessarily say that everything went according to plan because of the
              inclusion and deletion of a few ideas; however,a great story of drama and decision-making resulted in the end.</p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>I cannot say that my skills are the best, but I am confident enough to say that I have improved greatly in my knowledge of Scratch programming, along with my ability to
              comprehend and create algorithms. I find the most challenging aspect of Scratch to be the creation of algorithms that call other algorithms because the blocks are simple enough to satisfy my task.</p>
