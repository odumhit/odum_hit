    <center><h2>The Experience</h2></center>
    <center><p>This program was done by my partner Jacqueline Guerra and I. We strived for something that was less typical than a filter which definitely made
    the programming a challenge. One of our major issues was setting an underlying background that would allow the selected image to be properly overlayed. The borders were 
    generally cut off and not connected to the overall background. While we did end up fixing it by resorting to a more heuristic algorithm, the image itself still does not 
    have clear, defined edges over the background.</p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>I found this project to be challenging because of the issues of lossy compression and source formatting. It allowed me to realize how I had to be careful when 
    choosing a selected file especially when trying to import it because when I was trying to work with a greater number of pixels, the look of the program would largely be affected with harsher, broader edges.
    During the process of choosing an image, I also had to make sure that the images being used were under "labeled for reuse" and noncopyrighted under google images. While this project did allow me 
    to gain the ability to merge images, I found the underlying decisions to be most important because it should be something that I'm always conscience of.</p>
