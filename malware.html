    <center><h2>The Experience</h2></center>
    <center><p>This research and presentation was done by my partner Robert Olivares and I. Our search through several articles allowed me explore well-known 
    concepts of hacking methods, and by the end of our research, I learned more about cryptography and how public and private key encryptions are vital to the security
    of people's safety through the Internet.</p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>The knowledge obtained from the inner-workings of malicious attacks online made me feel prepared to face one of these types of malware. I need to 
    be a lot more careful when using internet through free connections and must be wary of any important interceptions through unknown emails. My anti-viruses should always 
    be kept up to date along with my firewalls, and sometimes I should be hesitant to move to new Windows updates due to the existence of early unknown flaws within its systems.</p>
