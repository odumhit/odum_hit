    <center><h2>The Experience</h2></center>
    <center><p>The research done for this presentation allowed me to gain a broader understanding of the different types of big data such as volume
    and velocity. Many computational artifacts involved complexities that relate to big data, and I ended up choosing robotic insect vision because of its 
    complexity with its different data types. In addition to understanding big data, I also explored the topic of its utilization of a "snap map" and mathematical equations
    that allow the plotting of the graph that is then converted to actual images. </p>

    <center><h2>My Reflection</h2></center>
    <center><p>I enjoyed the mix of science and computer science during the research of this project. Big data became less of an abstract concept to me by the end of it 
    because I no longer viewed the term "big data" as something vague. My perception directly relates to its volume and velocity as a complex computation that requires
    much calculation to understand.</p>
